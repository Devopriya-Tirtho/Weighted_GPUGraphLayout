1.10--  Added the --clearfrom option, so you can input a clear text
        password from a file.

1.07--  Inserted the omitted parsing for the --string option.  Cleaned up a
        bit of documentation.  Thanks to netgod of debian.org for hounding
        me until I fixed this. :)

1.06--  Initial release.
