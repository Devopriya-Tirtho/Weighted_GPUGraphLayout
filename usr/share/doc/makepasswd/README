As has been my custom of late, this program is released under the terms of
GNU COPYING-2.  Don't apply any other version of the GNU license to it. If
some legal precedent ends up biting us in the nose, write me and I'll tweak
the license accordingly.

In that case, or in case you want to laud or castigate me for some imagined
slight, feel free to email me at lilo@linpeople.org.
